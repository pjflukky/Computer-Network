Q2: Prediction estimates: RTT = L1_avg + L2_avg + L3_avg = 80.345ms + 20.648ms + 60.607ms = 161.6ms 
                        : Throughput = min_throughput(L1, L2, L3) = L1 = 18.940 Mb/s 
    actual result: RTT = 160.461ms
		   Throughput = 18.555 Mb/s
    explanation: the prediction is very close to the actual result.
