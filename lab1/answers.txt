Q2: Prediction estimates: RTT = L1_avg + L2_avg + L3_avg = 80.345ms + 20.648ms + 60.607ms = 161.6ms 
                        : Throughput = min_throughput(L1, L2, L3) = L1 = 18.940 Mb/s 
    Actual result: RTT = 160.461ms
		   Throughput = 18.555 Mb/s
    Explanation: the prediction is very close to the actual result. Since we increased the path of the 
    network we must consider the sum of the delays to get the overall delay since latency of 1 link is
    independent from the next when sending a packet. 
    The throughput rate also holds since in the flow of the network we are limited to the slowest link
    and in this case that independentlink was ~18.9Mbps so our estimate was very close. 
Q3: Mulitplexing Prediction: To estimate the throughput we thought that due to the nature of network
    flow that the latency would be determined by two factors: link latency and queueing latency. If 
    the switch can handle a the incoming packets and queue them the latency will just be the slowest 
    link + some queueing delay. Throughput will likely be scaled by the degree of multiplexing such 
    that the throughput will halve when multiplexing doubles. 
    # Latency 
    Prediction of 3-way multiplexing: ~160ms
    Prediction of 2-way multiplexing: ~160ms or slightly less
    # Throughput
    Prediction of 2-way multiplexing: ~8.9Mb/s
    Prediction of 3-way multiplexing: ~6.1Mb/s
    # Results 
    Throughput 
    (Values from h1, h7, h8)
    Outcome of 2-way multiplexing: ~12.6Mb/s (23.2Mb/s, 2.3Mb/s, 12.3Mb/s  Avg = 12.6Mb/s)
    Outcome of 2-way multiplexing: ~12.6Mb/s (23.2Mb/s, 2.3Mb/s, 12.3Mb/s  Avg = 12.6Mb/s)
    Outcome of 3-way multiplexing: ~8.9Mb/s

    Ending, answers varied run from run due to xterm and mininet timing issues, but
    generally around estimates.
